    <h3><em>A variation on an English classic. Perfect for a picnic.</em></h3>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g chestnut mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 leeks, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, crushed </li>
        <li>1 tbsp finely chopped sage leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown rice miso</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>30g chestnuts, very finely chopped </li>
        <li>70g fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 x 320g sheet ready-rolled puff pastry (not the all-butter version)</li>
        <li>plain flour for dusting</li>
        <li>dairy-free milk (like soya milk), to glaze </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the mushrooms into a food processor and pulse until they are very finely chopped. Put half the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the leeks along with a pinch of salt and fry gently for 15 mins or until softened and golden brown. Scrape the leeks out of the pan, into a bowl and set aside to cool a little.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in the pan and fry the mushrooms for 10 mins over a medium heat. Add the garlic, sage, miso and mustard, and fry for a further minute. Leave to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the mushroom mixture into the bowl with the leeks, then add the chestnuts and breadcrumbs. Season, then mix everything together until you have a slightly stiff mixture.</li>
        <li>Unravel the pastry on a floured surface, then roll the pastry out so that one side measures 43 cm. Mould the mushroom and leek mixture into a sausage shape down the centre of the pastry, then bring the pastry up around the filling and seal along the seam with a fork. Cut into ten pieces. Lay on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush each piece with milk. Bake for 25 mins or until deep, golden brown. Leave to cool a little and sprinkle with sesame seeds before serving.</li>
